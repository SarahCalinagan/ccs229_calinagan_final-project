## Description

The FitsQuestBOT is an innovative application that empowers users to design personalized workout plans using a combination of Streamlit for the user interface and Google's Generative AI for creative text generation. The project leverages Google's Gemini-Pro API to generate detailed exercise challenge plans based on user inputs and preferences.

## Project Setup

The application is written in Python and utilizes Streamlit for creating the user interface. Google's Generative AI library is integrated into the project for advanced natural language processing capabilities. The setup involves initializing the Gemini-Pro model and starting a chat session to interact with the AI model.

## Libraries used

- **streamlit**: Used for building the user interface and handling user inputs.
- **google-generativeai**: Integrated for interacting with Google's API to generate creative text formats.
- **Other**: Standard Python libraries such as os for backend processing and logic.

## Functionalities

- **Multi-Level Prompting**: Users are guided through a series of prompts to refine the creative direction of their exercise challenge plan.
- **Personalization**: Users can specify their fitness goals, preferred exercise types, available equipment, and any constraints or preferences they have.
- **Creative Exercise Plans**: The system generates detailed exercise challenge plans tailored to the user's inputs, providing a comprehensive workout schedule.
- **Interactive Interface**: The Streamlit interface makes the interaction intuitive, allowing users to customize their exercise plans effortlessly.
- **Secure API Key Management**: The Google API key is securely palced inside the streamlit 'secret' tab in app settings.
